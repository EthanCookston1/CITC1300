            <h1 class="heading_style"> Welcome to the World of Dark Souls 2</h1>
        <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236430/DARK_SOULS_II/" target="_blank">Dark Souls 2</a> is the second game in the Dark Souls Trilogy,and is the most controversial game in the series.</p>

        <h2 class="heading_style">Development of the Sequel</h2>
        <p>Development for Dark Souls 2 had a different team than Dark Souls 1, as that team was working on a different game for the Playstation 4 Exclusively. This led to problems with development, along with the director being changed midway through development, causing many things to be changed before release.</p>

        <aside id="col2"> <h3 class="heading_style">Facts about Dark Souls 2 and other games</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The game has a ton of replay value through the world constantly changing each time you beat the game or use a specific item.</li>
            <li>Dark Souls 2 has a full rebalance rerelease called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/335300/DARK_SOULS_II_Scholar_of_the_First_Sin/" target="_blank">Scholar of the First Sin</a> which changes tons of things about the world, enemy placement, and has the dlc included.</li>
            <li>Before Elden Ring destroyed this number with over 200, Dark Souls 2 had the most bosses of the so called "Soulsborne" series, unless we count Bloodborne's reused bosses for it's dungeon mode.</li>
            <li>Dark Souls 2 allowed you to dual wield, or "power stance", two weapons at the same time, before Dark Souls 3 kinda introduced dual weapons, but they were much more limiting as the weapon itself had to be a dual weapon, before Elden Ring brough this back.</li>

              </ul>

    <h4 class="heading_style">References to Dark Souls 1</h4>
        <p>While Dark Souls 1 and 3 are very connected despite having insanely long time between both entries, Dark Souls 2 has to have a lot more subtle references and easter eggs to Dark Souls 1, one of the big ones is the four main bosses before you unlock the final areas have the boss soul of a Dark Souls 1 boss if you beat them in New Game Plus, showing that their soul eventually transformed into the new bosses.</p>
