        <h1 class="heading_style">The New Development Team</h1>
        <p>Dark Souls 2 was headed by a whole different team like I said before, which means while Miyazaki, the original director, was busy with the new playstation game, a different director was in charge of the game, making it feel the most <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-2-the-difficult-second-game" target="blank">different</a> compared to the other two games.</p>

        <h2 class="heading_style">Gameplay Differences to Dark Souls 1</h2>
        <p>Dark Souls 2 added a ton of <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dark-souls-2/Dark_Souls_vs_Dark_Souls_2" target="blank">features and differences</a> that only appeared in this game, or only one other game. This is because the team who worked on Dark Souls 3 was the original Dark Souls 1 team, which made the game more in line to DS1 than DS2, but still added things from the game so it isn't entirely ignored.</p>
        
        <h3 class="heading_style">Some of the gameplay features exclusive to DS2 include</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Power Stance, the abilty to wield two weapons and have them use a unique moveset.</li>
            <li>New Game Plus in New Game, If you use an item called a Bonfire Ascetic, it basically turns the current area into it's New Game Plus counterpart, allowing new items and enemies to be found.</li>
            <li>Health Loss on Death, Unlike Dark Souls 1, where you only lose your humanity on death, with each death you lose 5% of your hp and it eventually caps at 50% lost, but you can remove it with a certain limited item.</li>
            <li>Only Game in the series to have a "Good" Ending. If you beat all of the DLCs and collect 4 crowns of the King bosses from the 3 DLC and main game, you can break the curse placed on you and have the most "good" ending in the series.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="heading_style">Dark Souls 2's impact on the series</h4>
        <p>Dark Souls 2 ended up being one of the franchise's and maybe even Fromsoft's most controversial title, for better or worse. It has some of the most passionate fans, and the most passionate haters. It really has an effect on people no matter what you end up thinking about the game.</p>
