        <h1>What's next for Elden Ring and Fromsoft?</h1>
        <p>
            After the release of Elden Ring, many people are wondering what is next for Fromsoftware and the Elden Ring series. Fromsoftware has said that they are working on a new game, but they have not said what it is yet. Many people are hoping that it is a new game in the Elden Ring series, but it could be something completely different. Fromsoftware has also said that they are working on a new game engine, which could mean that they are working on a new game that is completely different from anything that they have done before. Whatever it is, many people are excited to see what Fromsoftware has in store for the future.

        <h2>Post Elden Ring: Nightreign</h2>
        <p>
            After Elden Ring: Nightreign release and its DLC at the end of the year, Fromsoft fans wonder what is next for the company and its big series. There are a few routes they could take and what they could do with the series. I'll delve into some speculation that me and fans of the series have been thinking about.

                <h3>Elden Ring 2</h3>
                <p>Before Elden Ring: Nightreign had been announced, Elden Ring 2 was up there as one of the less big things people were thinking that was coming next, just due to how big Elden Ring is and how big an Elden Ring sequel would have to be, so to be honest this is not looking likely as the next thing Fromsoft releases.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h3>Bloodborne Remaster or Sequel</h3>
                <p>Bloodborne is one of Fromsoft's series that despite not having really any connection to Dark Souls or Elden Ring, plays very similarly to both and has a giant following. Despite that it has only had the original release and the DLC on PS4. Fans have been wanting a better version of Bloodborne to play since the original release is very limited due to the console it is on, but it has been radio silent from Sony on anything Bloodborne related. So despite this being one of the most wanted things from Fromsoft, people still think it will not happen.</p>

            <div class="column">
                <h3>A Secret Third Option</h3>
                <p>It is very likely that Fromsoft releases another game that plays nothing like any of their Soulslike games, like they did with Armored Core 6 recently in 2023, since it has been awhile since they did anything with their other series after Dark Souls and Elden Ring took off with insane popularity.</p>
