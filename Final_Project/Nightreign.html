            Elden Ring: Nightreign
        </h1>
        <p>
            Elden Ring: Nightreign is the newest game in the Elden Ring series, and is a spin-off of the main game. The game is set in a slightly different world as the original game, with massive changes to the gameplay while still keeping the same core mechanics that made Elden Ring so popular. It has yet to release, but has had an online network test so we have gotten our hands on the game.

        <h2>
            Changes to the gameplay
        </h2>
        <p>
            Nightreign has a lot of changes to the gameplay that are not in the main game, such as a new leveling system, new weapons and armor, and new bosses to fight. The game also has a new magic system that is more like a traditional RPG, with different spells and abilities that you can use to defeat your enemies. The game also allows you to either fight solo, or with a group of 3 peple while picking from 8 different base classes with more to come.

        <h3>
            Uncertain about the game
        </h3>
        <p>
            Before and during the network test, much of the community was sceptcul about the game, with many people saying that the game was too different from the main game, and that it was not what they were expecting. However, after the network test, many people have changed their minds about the game, with many people saying that it is a great game that is worth playing, and with the game not even being out yet, there is so much we still do not know about it, such as 4 of the 8 classes, what the DLC is looking like, or all of the bosses tha t will be returning to the game. Much is to be discovered in this game when it comes out and personally I am excited.
