            <p>
                Elden Ring: Shadow the Erdtree is the first and only DLC for Elden Ring, and it released in 2024. It allows you to explore a whole different areas with a different level up system, and new bosses to fight. The DLC also adds new weapons, spells, and items for you to find and use in the game.

                Features of Shadow of the Erdtree
            </h2>
            <p>
                Shadow of the Erdtree introduces scadutree fragments, a whole new way to level up exclusive to the area in the dlc. Alongside that, there are over 150 new weapons added to the game, with several new spells and items to find and use in the game. With 40 new bosses and 10 main bosses in that lot, there will be a lot of new content that people say is even harder than the base game to go through and experience for the first time.

                Community Reaction to the DlC
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Community was very excited for the DLC, since they wanted more Elden Ring content after the amazing base game, but with some questionable story additions, the DLC seemingly beening unfairly difficult even compared to how hard Elden Ring itself was, and on certain consoles it had some pretty bad performance souring the taste for many fans.
