            Connections between Elden Ring and Dark Souls
        </h1>
        <p>
            Elden Ring is a game that is very connected to the Dark Souls series, with many references and easter eggs to the series. The game is also a spiritual successor to the Dark Souls series, with many of the same mechanics and features that are in the Dark Souls series. The game also has many of the same enemies and bosses that are in the Dark Souls series, with some of them being reimagined for the game.

            <h3>References to Dark Souls 1 in Elden Ring</h3>
            <p> Dark Souls 1 has many different references in Elden Ring, from the subtle to the straight up undenyable. With one of the bosses in Elden Ring, the Erdtree Avatar has a moveset that is very similar to a boss in Dark Souls 1, the Stray Demon. Both bosses use a similar giant hammer shaped weapon, and have several variations throughout both games. While that could be said to just be a coincidence, some weapons from Dark Souls 1 appear in Elden Ring, like the very iconic Zweihander, which is a weapon that is very popular in the Dark Souls series. Not to mention that certain bosses like the Centipede Demon from Dark Souls 1 will be returning for Elden Ring: Nightreign later this year.</p>

            <h3>References to Dark Souls 2 in Elden Ring</h3>
            <p>Many people say that Elden Ring 2 is Dark Souls 2 2, which is funny once you hear it, but some of the things brought up does make some sense. Power Stancing weapons originally started off in Dark Souls 2, which is the ability to use two different weapons at the same time with their own moveset, then this feature would be absent in Dark Souls 3, with it returning in Elden Ring. Alongside this of course is bosses from Dark Souls 2 showing up in Elden Ring: Nightreign with the Duke's Dear Freja.</p>

            <h3>References to Dark Souls 3 in Elden Ring</h3>
            <p>Elden Ring shares a ton of it's gameplay with Dark Souls 3, as it is the game preceding it. The game has a lot of the same mechanics, such as the weapon arts system, the ability to dual wield weapons, and the ability to use magic and spells. The game also has many of the same enemies and bosses that are in Dark Souls 3, with some of them being reimagined for the game. Alongside DS1 and DS2, DS3 will be having some of it's iconic bosses like the Nameles King appearing in Elden Ring: Nightreign.</p>
