        <h2>Development of the Sequel</h2>
        <p>Development for Dark Souls 2 had a different team than Dark Souls 1, as that team was working on a different game for the Playstation 4 Exclusively.</p>

        <h3>Facts about the game and its world</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The game has a ton of replay value through the world constantly changing each time you beat the game or use a specific item.</li>
            <li>Dark Souls 2 has a full rebalance rerelease called Scholar of the First Sin, which changes tons of things about the world, enemy placement, and has the dlc included.</li>
            <li>Before Elden Ring destroyed this number with over 200, Dark Souls 2 had the most bosses of the so called "Soulsborne" series, unless we count Bloodborne's reused bosses for it's dungeon mode.</li>
            <li>Dark Souls 2 allowed you to dual wield, or "power stance", two weapons at the same time, before Dark Souls 3 kinda introduced dual weapons, but they were much more limiting as the weapon itself had to be a dual weapon, before Elden Ring brough this back.</li>

              </ul>
              
              
    

        <h4>Community's Thoughts on the game</h4>
        <p>This game is known as the black sheep of the Dark Souls series, with some people thinking it's easily the best, while others think it's easily the worst. Me personally I think I sit more on the side of the game being good, but with the two different versions, it can be hard to really tell, since the gameplay experience can change a ton with both version of the game.</p>
