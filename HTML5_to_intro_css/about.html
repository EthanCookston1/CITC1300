        <h1>The New Development Team</h1>
        <p>Dark Souls 2 was headed by a whole different team like I said before, which means I'll add more to this later dont forget lol</p>

        <h2>Gameplay Differences to Dark Souls 1</h2>
        <p>Dark Souls 2 added a ton of gameplay features that only appeared in this game, or only one other game. This is because the team who worked on Dark Souls 3 was the original Dark Souls 1 team, which made the game more in line to DS1 than DS2, but still added things from the game so it isn't entirely ignored.</p>
        <h3>Some of the gameplay features exclusive to DS2 include</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Power Stance</li>
            <li>New Game Plus in New Game?</li>
            <li>Health Loss on Death</li>
            <li>Only Game in the series to have a "Good" Ending</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Dark Souls 2's impact on the series</h4>
        <p>Dark Souls 2 ended up being one of the franchise's and maybe even Fromsoft's most controversial title, for better or worse. It has some of the most passionate fans, and the most passionate haters. It really has an effect on people no matter what you end up thinking about the game.</p>
